Dear Jeongseak,

I am sorry that I had to attend the International Conference in High
Energy Physics a week ago and cannot take care of replying to you.

I have found the fortran programs to calculate the results in my paper
PRC84, 024901 (2011).  They are attached here in this email as a tar
file
        mkLHCpack.tar.gz

which you can expand it out.  Inside the package are the fortran
programs.

   For the dN/ptdpt The fortran program is mkLHC.f

   which is based on an earlier fortran  momkick02.f

I have also found the fortran program to calculate the number of
participants and number of kicked medium number.

The fortran program is

                          ppbb.f

The input and output files associated with ppbb.f are also in the package.

The input and output files for all the fortran programs are also in the
attached package.

You mentioned that you get a different plot of number of kicked medium
particles versus Nch (my figure 4).  You may note that there is a
paragraph which talks about the "initial time t0" on the paragraph
after Eq. (32).  Have you taken into account this t0.

To compare your numbers with my graphs, it may be necessary for me to
talk to you on zoom to find out where the differences are and we can
then discuss the differences.  It is hard to know why until we can sit
down and discuss the numbers because there are many possibilities.  If
you wish to talk by zoom, let me know and we can arrange a zoom time
to talk.

Please send my warmest regards to Prof. Yoon and her family for me.

Best regards!
